Pull the code; otherwise, download the ZIP file.
Then, in Visual Studio Code, open the code. 
Afterward, go to the terminal, run `cmd`, navigate to the frontend folder, and type `npm i` to install the Node modules. 
Similarly,
for the backend, go to the backend folder and run the command `npm i` or `yarn add package.json` to install the Node modules. 
Once both Node modules are installed, run `yarn start` or `npm start` in the frontend, and in the backend, type `nodemon server.js` to run the projects."
